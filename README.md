Place to host my blogs

This repo will contain the code needed to create a docker file that can be hosted on AWS EC2 instances using Elastic Beanstalker.

An exercise and time killer project of my own.

Hoping that with the project, I will be getting my AWS certificate as well as completing this long-waited activity, two birds with one stone.

Good Luck to myself.
